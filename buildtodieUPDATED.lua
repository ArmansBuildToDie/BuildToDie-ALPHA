ðŸŽƒ Happy Halloween! New update added as of 10/16/2020 10:45 PM ðŸŽƒ

~= Whats new? =~
--> Build To Die ClientBot now needs to be updated with the most recent version of Roblox using the built in _VERSION function. (don't worry about it though.)
-^ This is because Roblox has been making tons of updates lately so if anything updates, I need to do a daily check-up.
-^ This will keep the scripts up to date. If your client isn't updated and needs updating PLEASE contact Arman#9312. 
-^ There will be an auto contacting feature in the future. 

--> SEASONAL UPDATES!

-^ BTD now has seasonal updates! These updates change up the music and UI a bit. Nothing much. 
-^ (note: this is auto so i don't have to do it manually ðŸ˜Ž)
